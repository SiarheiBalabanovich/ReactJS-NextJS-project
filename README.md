## About the Project:
This is a [React.js](https://react.dev/) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How to Run the Project:
To start the development server, you can use one of the following commands depending on your package manager:
1. For npm: npm run dev
2. For yarn: yarn dev
3. For pnpm: pnpm dev
4. For bun: bun run dev

## Once the server is running, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the project in action.

## Editing the Project:
To make changes, start by modifying the app/page.js file. 
Any updates you make will automatically reflect in the browser without needing a page refresh.

## Font Optimization:
The project utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to ensure optimal loading and rendering of the Inter font from Google.

## Deployment on Vercel:
The easiest way to host your Next.js app is to use Vercel [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme), the platform created by the same team behind Next.js. 
For more information on how to deploy, check out the deployment guide [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).
